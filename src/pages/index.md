  # Hello Iâ€™m Sebastian Paas


  ## A full-stack web developer from Germany


  I am passionate about building beautiful web applications, with or without animations. But I don't just play with JavaScript and CSS. Find out what else I know on my [Technology Radar](/#skills). Everything else I can learn on the fly.

  title: About Me
  text: >-
    I'm a [age] Years old Software developer who is always interested in
    learning and building software applications.


    However, that is probably what every one says, right? But yes, diving into a new Language, Concept or Framework to become a better developer always gets me excited. Even seemingly endless pages of documentation become very attractive if I can use this knowledge to improve my programming skills. It's like getting up from the couch to go for a run. It takes a bit of discipline, but as soon as you get going there is only smooth sailing ahead.




    Even though I love programming, I am way too fascinated by nature to sit all day before a computer. Instead, I also go running through the forest or enjoy my aquarium. I always make sure that my plants and animals are flourishing. But normally that is not a problem. I can even be on long vacation trips without having to worry about my aquarium. Longer stays abroad are perfect for going to language schools and to learning about a different culture. I did my first language vacation in Malta, where I discovered that my English is already quite good. So Spanish became my next goal and I took a six-week vacation with Spanish lessons in Malaga. However, after my stay in Malaga, I sadly had to pause my vacation streak duo to corona.




    If you think I am an interesting character, and you would like to work with me, you can always [contact me](/contact).
