  text: >-
    Hi, I am Sebastian. I'm a \[age] Years old full-stack Software developer
    with an endless curiosity.


    But I am not just passionate about learning new programming concepts, languages, frameworks or patterns. I also love to know the application of my software solutions. May that be the process of inspecting bottles for foreign objects or real estate valuation. Not knowing why I have to solve a problem is hard to bear for me. 


    In my free time I am currently learning Spanish and extending my Math knowledge. At the same time I try to constantly improve my learning technique and approaches to become more time efficient in the process. My favorite book about learning is currently "[A mind for numbers](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Barbara-Oakley-ebook/dp/B00G3L19ZU)" by Ph.D. Barbara Oakley. 


    I always strive to deeply understand a topic and to avoid the illusion of competence by focusing on the areas I find the most difficult. 


    I am currently interested in new job opportunities and challenges so don't hesitate to [contact me](/contact).
